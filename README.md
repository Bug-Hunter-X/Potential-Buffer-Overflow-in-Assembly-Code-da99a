This repository demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in a small assembly code snippet.  The vulnerability arises from the lack of bounds checking in memory access, leading to potential crashes or unexpected behavior.  The `bug.asm` file showcases the vulnerable code, while `bugSolution.asm` provides a corrected version with added boundary checks to prevent the overflow.  The issue is explained in detail within the code comments.  This example highlights the importance of careful memory management and bounds checking in assembly programming.
